Localize Robot using Bayes Filter
(Odometry based sensor model)

In this project Grid Localization is used which is a variant of discrete Bayes Localization (map is an occupancy grid). A rosbag with series of motion and sensor messages are given. Using these messages, the robot has to be localized. 

How to run:
1. Add the project to the catkin workspace
2. catkin_make
3. roslaunch lab4.launch
