Path Planning using A* search algorithm

In this project, a robot in Stage Simulator needs to be moved towards the destination with a planned path. This planned path is computed using A* search algorithm. The simuated world is discretized into grids, on which the algorithm is executed. Once, the path is calculated, the robot moves in the path.

How to run:
1. Add the project to the catkin workspace
2. catkin_make
3. roslaunch lab5.launch
